# Bar Chart
In this README-Bar-Chart file, there will be descriptions and explanations for the project.  
  
## Description
In this project, we are asked to make a bar chart for the US GDP using D3.js Library.  
  
### Test/User Stories
The test or user stories that must be passed are:  
1. My chart should have a title with a corresponding id="title"
2. My chart should have a g element x-axis with a corresponding id="x-axis"
3. My chart should have a g element y-axis with a corresponding id="y-axis"
4. Both axes should contain multiple tick labels, each with the corresponding class="tick"
5. My chart should have a rect element for each data point with a corresponding class="bar" displaying the data
6. Each bar should have the properties data-date and data-gdp containing date and GDP values
7. The bar elements' data-date properties should match the order of the provided data
8. The bar elements' data-gdp properties should match the order of the provided data
9. Each bar element's height should accurately represent the data's corresponding GDP
10. The data-date attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the x-axis
11. The data-gdp attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the y-axis
12. I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area
13. My tooltip should have a data-date property that corresponds to the data-date of the active area
