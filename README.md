# FreeCodeCamp Data Visualization Project 

At the end of the Data Visualization Curriculum on FreeCodeCamp. There are 5 projects that needs to be done, in order to get the Data Visualization Certificate.

The projects are:
1. Creating a Bar Chart for the United States GDP Data
2. Creating a Scatter Plot Graph for Doping Cases in Professional Bicycle Racing

## D3.js Library
To use the d3.js you can simply put it in your HTML file inside a script tag.  
Below is the link for the D3.js library:  
https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js  
  
Below is the example of putting it inside a script tag:    
```<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>```  
  
## Test CDN Link
Each projects have their own tests or user stories that must be passed in order to submit the projects and gained the certificate.  
To run the test in any environment you want, you need to use the CDN link provided in the project webpage in FreeCodeCamp like below:  
```<script src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js"></script>```

For each projects it will have its own README file in this repository. That includes the explanation of each code that i wrote.  
  
Note:  
This documentation is created for practice, so it may not be an example of a good documentation but i will try my best. And also each code may not be the best practice since i was still a first year university student and is still learning. I hope this could help other people who might be stuck doing the projects or just wanting to see how other people did their project. Thank you.
